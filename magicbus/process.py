class ProcessBus(base.Bus):
    """A Bus subclass for managing the state of a process.

    In general, there should only ever be a single ProcessBus object
    per process. Frameworks and site containers share a single ProcessBus
    by publishing messages and subscribing listeners.

    The ProcessBus works as a state machine which models the current
    state of the process. ProcessBus methods transition it from one state
    to another; those methods publish to subscribed listeners on the
    new state's channel after setting the new state. A simplified model
    might be::

              _start_
             /       \
            V         \
           RUN       IDLE --exit--> EXITED
            \         A
             \_______/
               stop

    But of course, nothing is ever so easy in the engineering world.
    In reality, start or stop could throw an error, or even fail to
    return. We *always* need an error handler (even if many states
    share the same one), and we *always* need to allow a transition,
    not just from one final state to another, but from the middle
    of start/stop to a new state. We model this by elevating each
    of our naive transitions to its own intermediate state, and adding
    error states. That is::

         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX START              XXXXXX-> EXIT_ERROR
         |              /   |   A            X            |
         V             V    |    \           X            V
    START_ERROR <-XX RUN    |    IDLE ----> EXIT ----> EXITED ---> X
         |             \    |    A| A
         |              V   V   / |  \
         +---------------> STOP   X    ENTER <--- INITIAL
                            X     X      X
                            |     |      X
                            V     V      X
                           STOP_ERROR <-XX

    Now the movement to the "RUN" state from the "IDLE" state encompasses
    two transitions, four if you count error transitions.
