# _module__file__base is used by Autoreload to make
# absolute any filenames retrieved from sys.modules which are not
# already absolute paths.  This is to work around Python's quirk
# of importing the startup script and using a relative filename
# for it in sys.modules.
#
# Autoreload examines sys.modules afresh every time it runs. If an application
# changes the current directory by executing os.chdir(), then the next time
# Autoreload runs, it will not be able to find any filenames which are
# not absolute paths, because the current directory is not the same as when the
# module was first imported.  Autoreload will then wrongly conclude the file
# has "changed", and initiate the shutdown/re-exec sequence.
# See ticket #917.
# For this workaround to have a decent probability of success, this module
# needs to be imported as early as possible, before the app has much chance
# to change the working directory.
